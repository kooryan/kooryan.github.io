            Outside of my classes I part of the Natural Language Processing group I am fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Dongyeop Kang and previously
                worked with Jaehyung Kim at KAIST. I am also fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Maria Gini and Dan Boley within the Swarm Robotics Group.

                When I'm not scratching my head over research or bugs, you can find me playing the cello (ask me about my
                 favorite classical pieces!), building keyboards, watching soccer, sleeping, or playing Starcraft II.
