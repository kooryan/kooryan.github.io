                I am currently a second-year student at the University of Minnesota studying Computer Science and Statistics. 
                I am a part of the Natural Language Processing group under the mentorship of Prof. Dongyeop Kang, as well as the Swarm Robotics group under the 
                mentorship of Prof. Maria Gini.
