            Outside of my classes I am part of the Natural Language Processing group where I am fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Dongyeop Kang and previously
                worked with Jaehyung Kim at KAIST and Yekyung Kim at Hyundai Motors. I am also fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Maria Gini, Dan Boley, and John Harwell within the Swarm Robotics Group.

                This past summer I had the opportunity to work at Wells Fargo as a software development intern.

                When I'm not scratching my head over research or messing around with code, you can find me playing the cello (ask me about my
                 favorite classical pieces!), building keyboards, watching and sometimes playing soccer (COYS), or sleeping.
