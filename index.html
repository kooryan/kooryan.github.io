  <h2>Project(s)</h2>

  <p class="p2"><strong>JavaFX</strong> | <a href="https://github.com/kooryan/JavaCalculator">Calculator</a>: The project that I am currently working on, the calculator is only capable of executing simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as of now, but will be improved to accomplish more complex functions. I also hope to improve my skills in CSS through designing a smooth and professional-looking GUI.</p>
